# CFG-CK-DataSQL-Project

This repository contains the SQL syntax and presentation materials for my project analyzing Londonâ€™s Quality of Life Indicators, completed as part of the CFG Code Kickstarter course on Intro to Data and SQL in December 2022.

## Introduction/Context: ##

- This project is an extension of my master's degree dissertation.
- It aimed to explore databases concerning quality of life factors when moving between London boroughs, encompassing variables beyond monetary costs, including public transport proximity and property visual quality.
- The indicators considered were Life Expectancy, Crime Deprivation, Income Deprivation, Housing Tenure, and Pollution (PM emissions), sourced from datasets available on the London Data Store website, specifically for the year 2019.

## Objectives: ##

- To apply the knowledge gained during the course, including creating databases, defining primary and foreign keys, generating database diagrams, implementing joins, creating stored functions, subqueries, stored procedures, triggers, and optional visualizations.
- To apply SQL functions to real-life scenarios by selecting relevant questions.

## Data Collection and Analysis: ##

- Careful selection of databases pertinent to real-life scenarios, utilizing datasets available for the common year (2019) where all datasets were publicly accessible.
- Ease of database creation, primary keys (pk), and foreign keys (fk) on MySQL due to common borough and borough code fields in the datasets.

## Key Learnings/Insights: ##

- Consideration of other influencing indicators when making relocation decisions, particularly tailored towards property buyers due to their long-term commitments.
- Identified significant potential in analyzing datasets separately over time to understand their impact on residents' health.
- Example: Hillingdon exhibited the most severe PM emissions concentration in 2019 compared to other boroughs, warranting a closer examination of policies aimed at rectifying this issue.
- Ability to consider multiple indicators and showcase results via mapping.

## Impact/Results: ##

- Advocating for a right to the city, I emphasise the need for policies aligned with community needs. Accessibility to easily readable data (via visualizations) empowers individuals to prioritize community issues.
- Heightened awareness of these indicators enables individuals to make informed decisions regarding relocation within boroughs.

## Challenges and Solutions: ##

- Crafting questions to demonstrate the database language's potential proved challenging, with subqueries presenting a particularly steep learning curve.
- Discrepancies between Tableau visualizations and SQL learning, although Tableau provided an opportunity to familiarize myself with map creation using shapefiles for London boroughs.
- Reminder to thoroughly check syntax, with minor errors discovered on slide 5. 

## Future Steps/Recommendations: ##

- Leveraging datasets available for smaller borough areas like MSOAs and LSOAs to enhance location precision in decision-making processes.
