# CFG-CK-DataSQL-Project

This repository includes the SQL syntax and presentation materials for my project analyzing Londonâ€™s Quality of Life Indicators, completed as part of the CFG Code Kickstarter course on Intro to Data and SQL in December 2022.

## Introduction/Context: ##

- This project is a follow-up to my master's degree dissertation
- I thought about working with databases with variables of quality of life when moving in between the London boroughs, besides monetary cost, public transport proximity and visual quality of the property
- The indicators considered were Life Expectancy, Crime Deprivation, Income Deprivation, Housing Tenure and Pollution (PM emissions), datasets available on the London Data Store website and I considered the year 2019

**Objectives:**

- The main goal was to practice what I learned during the short course: creating databases, setting primary and foreign keys, database diagrams, showing joins applications, creating a stored function, subquery, stored procedure, trigger and some visualisations at the end (optional)
- I particularly wanted to apply it in a real-life situation, therefore hopefully, the questions I selected to use SQL functions make sense

## Data Collection and Analysis: ##

- I selected the databases that would make sense to consider for a real-life situation and selected the same year where all datasets were publicly available
- That way it was easy to create the databases, pk and fk on MySQL since all the dataset has the borough and the borough code in common
- It was challenging to think about the questions to showcase the potential of the database language and especially subquery was particularly very challenging.
- The Tableau visualisations do not reflect the same level of learning of the SQL language. However, it was good to familiarise myself with how easy it is to create maps with this new software and besides the databases, I had to use a shapefile from London with the boroughs.

**Key Learnings/Insights:**

- There are other indicators influencing the decision as to where someone should move and perhaps the ones I choose for this project are more inclined to be considered for the ones who are buying properties, since it is a long-term commitment.
- There is a lot of potential in working with these datasets, also separately and seeing how they change through the years and what impact they have on the resident's health.
- For example, Hillingdon showed by far the worst concentration of pm emissions in 2019 compared to other boroughs it is worth considering what policies are in place to change this scenario.
- It is possible to consider multiple indicators and show the results on a map.
